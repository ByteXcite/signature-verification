# VerSign: An Off-Line Signature Verification System
This core signature verification code has been moved to a separate repository at [saifkhichi96/versign-core](https://www.github.com/saifkhichi96/versign-core). It is also packaged as a ready-to-use library on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/versign/) and can be installed with `pip`.

The (incomplete) source code of the VerSign client applications (Android, Desktop and web clients previously in this repo) now resides at [saifkhichi96/authentica](https://github.com/saifkhichi96/authentica) and is currently under development as standalone applications.

## Disclaimer
This project was initially completed in 2018 by @mmahadt, @saifkhichi96 and @bilalahmad1995 as part of our Bachelor thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Imran Malik.
